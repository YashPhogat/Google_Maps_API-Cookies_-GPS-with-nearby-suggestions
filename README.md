# app
In this web app i have used the google maps api and the places library of the api.
1.First i set a default location for maps api with certain zoom value and map type
2.Then i used the geolocation service to obtain the current coordinates of the device and set it as the centre for the map
3.Now using the places library, i did a search of nearby places on the basis of prominence of the place around.
4. Now create markers for the nearby places and display the images of the locations on marker click.
5.Using cookies store the previous location of the device.
